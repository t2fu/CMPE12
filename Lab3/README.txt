Lab 3: MIPS Looping ASCII Art
CMPE 012 Winter 2019

CruzID: tfu6
-------------------------
The text of your prompts are stored in the processor’s memory. After
assembling your program, what is the range of addresses in which these strings
are stored?
The range of addresses in which these strings are stored is from 0x0000 0000 to 0x1001 002f.

What were the learning objectives of this lab?
The learning objective of this lab is to understands the MIPS ISA using MARS
Assembler and Runtime Simulator. The student should also understand the coding
and commenting format in MIP Assembly Language Programming. The student should
have a complete understanding on how to code a program that allow user interaction
and complete the tesk with loops according to user inputs.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found
enjoyable?
I did encounter some issues when I am trying to translate my logic, which was
written in Java code, to MIP Assembly Language. The code between Java and
MIP Assembly Language is really different and I found it enjoyable to translate
between these two languages. I also found making loops and print out symbols
with MIP Assembly Language interesting.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I would simplify my program by delete the overused logics in the code.
I would also use other MIP Assembly Language Programming to simplify
my codes and make them more efficient.

Did you collaborate with anyone on this lab? Please list who you collaborated
with and the nature of your collaboration.
I did not collaborate with any individual on this lab.
