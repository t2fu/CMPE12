Lab 5: Subroutines
CMPE 012 Winter 2019
Fu, Tiancheng
CruzID: tfu6
-------------------------
What was your design approach?
I created multiple of array uses to store the user inputs and the results of
the inputs after the subroutines. The subroutines access the different
array in the program and change the values in their addresses. The program
first will output message to the user and allow the user to inputs and save the
input to different arrays. Then the "cipher" subroutine will decides the encrypt and
decrypt procress. At last, the "print_strings" subroutine will output the resulting
encrypt/decrypt string arrays to the user.

What did you learn in this lab?
I learned how to use subroutine and the stack in MIPS programming. In addition, I learned how
to use the Caesar Cipher method to decode and encode string value.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found
enjoyable?
I did encounter some issues when I am trying impelement subroutines and the stack
in MIPS language. I have learned subroutines and the stock in other Computer Science classes;
however, this is my first time to implement subroutines and the stack in MIPS
language. I found the Caesar Cipher method extremely interesting since I could use
the same method to create password makers and decoders.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I would simplify my program and my logic by delete the overused codes in my program.
I would also use other MIP Assembly Language Programming to simplify my codes and
make them more efficient.
