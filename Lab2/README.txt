Lab 2: Whack-A-Mole

-------------------------
What were the learning objectives of this lab?
In this Lab, I learned how to subtracting binary using 2's complement and how
to implement 2's complement into circuits. I also learned how to use flip flop
and the characteristic of the flip flop such as that flip flop is edge triggered
and the data would not pass through the flip flop, thus, it would not update the
value to the register.

What was your design approach?
There are four bit registers and when adding the circuit will check the value in
the last counted bit register and count toward to the next bit register if the
last counted bit register already have a 1 in it. The subtraction is finished with
the logic of 2's complement, the circuit will add 1 to the largest bit register
to achieves each indivdual subtraction through 2's complement. The Sign and Magnitude
displays logics are finished with similar logics used in the Register Value display and are
contacted with the results of the registers.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found
enjoyable?
The biggest issue I encountered in this Lab is trying to figure out an efficent flip flop
logic that will allow me to update the register and adder values. This is the part I found
most time consuming and enjoyable.

How would you redesign this lab assignment to make it better?
I would simplify my circuit by delete the overused logics in the circuits.
I would also use other Multimedia Logics to simplify my circuits and
make them more efficient. At last, I would simplify my comments because
I think they are too complicated.
