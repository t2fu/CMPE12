LAB 1: Intro to Logic Simulation
CMPE 012 Fall 2018
Fu, Tiancheng
CruzID: tfu6
-------------------------
What did you learn in this lab?
From this lab I learned how to create fundamental circuit with the Multimedia
Logic application. I also learned how to create and organize truth table with
AND and OR gates. In the same time, I learned how to use NAND and NOR gates
and how to use them to create AND and OR gates.

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
The Circuits I created all generate the correct outputs and they all in relatively
clear formats. I am able to implement all of my logic into circuits. The only
issue I encounter is when I just have my hands touch on the Multimedia Logic tools
I have no clue what I should do what so ever but now I know how to use the Multimedia
Logic tools.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I would simplify my circuit by delete the overused logics in the circuits.
I would also use other Multimedia Logic tools like ground tool that I did not use to simplify
my circuits. At last, I would shorten my comments because I think they are too
complicated.
