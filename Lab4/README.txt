Lab 4: ASCII (HEX or 2SC) to Base 4
CMPE 012 Winter 2019
Fu, Tiancheng
CruzID: tfu6
-------------------------
What was your approach to converting each ASCII input to two’s complement
form?
I converted all the bit in the input arguments into  two's complement
form with the ASCII code for binary number 1 to F; then convert the input
arguments in to 32 bits two's complement and save the converted input
arguments into $s1 and $s2 register respectively.

What did you learn in this lab?
I learned how to decode a register value. I also learned how to access and get
value out of memory locations. I acknowledged how to use MIPS code to change a value
in a specific address and extend a value in an address to 32-bit.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found
enjoyable?
I did encounter some issues when I am trying to convert the Hex or Decimal
input argument into 2SC 32-bit sign-extend values with MIP Assembly Language
and ASCII codes. I also found challenging to learn how to get accesses from
the memory locations and save a value into a memory location or transfering
different values between memory location. However, I found the process of
learning how computer memories really work interesting since I have never
really learn about it before.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I would simplify my program and my logic by delete the overused codes in my program.
I would also use other MIP Assembly Language Programming to simplify my codes and
make them more efficient.
